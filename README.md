### Notes

- controller have to be following the [laravel convention](https://laravel.com/docs/master/controllers)
- `Closure` routes wont have a link
- in order for controller link to redirect to the correct place
    - make sure the `terminal.integrated.scrollback` is set to big number ex.`100000` or even more if you have a very long list, otherwise you might get redirected to wrong controller.
    - if the controllers still doesnt show up in the popup, try restarting the editor
